# Jukeboxâ™ªd

  This is the monorepo for Jukebox'd.
## Product Vision

**Jukeboxd** is a music review platform designed for music enthusiasts who want to rate songs and albums they like or dislike. Our website caters to users seeking personalized music suggestions and those who want to know what to avoid.

**Unlike Letterboxd**, which focuses on movies, Jukeboxd is dedicated to the world of music, providing a space for in-depth reviews and ratings of individual songs and albums.


The **deployed app** can be viewed at: https://kind-pebble-01340fc1e.5.azurestaticapps.net/

And the **backend** can be accessed from: https://jukeboxd-music.azurewebsites.net/
